# NoteMeNot

A RubyMotion OS X app that allows the user to quickly hit a hotkey and store a small short-form "post-it" style note, that is then available for viewing, editing (and deleting) in the menu bar.

It was built as an example application to demonstrate how quick it can be to start building OS X apps and adding interesting features with RubyMotion, for a talk given at SRUG on Tuesday 6th May 2014.

More information about the talk, including the accompanying slides, is available at http://kickcode.com/blog/2014/05/07/how-to-get-started-building-mac-os-x-apps-with-rubymotion-fast.html.
